# Request registration

## ISO Registration

(see [below](#quicktime-registration) for QuickTime registration)

In order to apply for an identifier to be registered, you must abide by the following terms established by ISO. (Note that RID stands for "registered identifier", a code-point in this case).

The party requesting a format identifier shall:

1.  apply using the Form and procedures supplied by the Registration Authority;
2.  include a description of the purpose of the registered identifier, and the required technical details as specified in the application form;
3.  provide contact information describing how a complete description can be obtained on a non-discriminatory basis;
4.  agree to institute the intended use of the granted RID within a reasonable time frame; and
5.  to maintain a permanent record of the application form and the notification received from the Registration Authority of a granted RID.

Applications with insufficient information, detail, or documentation, may be returned by the registration authority for clarification. Please be as complete and clear as possible.

Items 1 through 5 will be published on the authority's web site. The remaining items are kept for the authority's records only, and are not published.

If your suggested code-point is already in use, or the authority considers that the suggested value is unsuitable or may be misleading, the authority may suggest an alternative value.

## QuickTime Registration

To register a code-point with this registration authority, please send email to _qtfourcc_ at _group.apple.com_ (we regret the lack of a hyperlink, and the "@" sign, but this is so that spammers' web crawlers will not find the address easily).

Please note that Apple Computer owns and defines the QuickTime file format, and Apple Computer makes no promise or undertaking to accept applications, and the definition and use of codes in the QuickTime file format are at Apple's sole discretion. If your suggested code-point is already in use, or Apple considers that the suggested value is unsuitable, may be misleading, or is otherwise inappropriate, the authority may suggest an alternative value or refuse the registration, at its sole discretion.

Note that codes using only lower-case letters are reserved to Apple.
