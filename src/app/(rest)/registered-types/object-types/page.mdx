# Object Types

This section documents the ObjectTypeIndication used in MPEG-4 systems to indicate the type of streams. Applications for a new codec type will also automatically receive an object type indication.

This table also occurs in ISO/IEC 14496-1 (various versions), the MPEG-4 systems specification. The intent is that the table maintained by this registration authority is the most up-to-date and definitive version.

There is also an informative table of the current [StreamType](#stream-types) allocations.

The values in both these tables are notated here in _hexadecimal_.

<DataDisplay csv="oti" />

1.  This type is used for all 14496-1 streams unless specifically indicated to the contrary. Scene Description scenes, which are identified with StreamType=03 (see Table 9), using this object type value shall use the BIFSConfig specified in section 9.3.5.2.2 of this specification.
2.  Used, with StreamType=03 (see Table 9), for Scene Description streams that use the BIFSv2Config. Its use with other StreamTypes is reserved.
3.  Includes associated Amendment(s) and Corrigendum(a). The actual object types are defined in ISO/IEC 14496-2 and are conveyed in the DecoderSpecificInfo as specified in ISO/IEC 14496-2, Annex K.
4.  Includes associated Amendment(s) and Corrigendum(a). The actual object types are defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3 and are conveyed in the DecoderSpecificInfo as specified in ISO/IEC 14496-3 subpart 1 subclause 6.2.1.
5.  Streams with this value with a StreamType indicating a systems stream (values 1,2,3, 6, 7, 8, 9) shall be treated as if the ObjectTypeIndication had been set to 01.
6.  For PNG Streams, the following configuration/rules apply:
    -   StreamType: 04 (visual)
    -   No decoder specific info needed
    -   The PNG stream shall consist in only one (1) AccessUnit
    -   The PNG stream access unit shall contain the complete PNG image/file
    -   MNG shall not be used inside PNG streams
7.  Includes associated Amendment(s) and Corrigendum(a). The actual object types are defined in ITU-T Recommendation H.264 | ISO/IEC 14496-10 and are conveyed in the DecoderSpecificInfo.
8.  Used, with StreamType=03, for Scene Description streams that use the BIFSConfigEx; its use with other StreamTypes is reserved. (Was previously reserved for MUCommandStream but not used for that purpose.)
9.  Used, with StreamType=03, for Scene Description streams that use the AFXConfig; its use with other StreamTypes is reserved.
