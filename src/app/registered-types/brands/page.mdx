# Brands

This table documents the file brand identifiers, as used in the file-type and segment-type boxes. Each brand uniquely identifies a specification to which the file conforms, and gives 'permission' for a reader implementing at least that specification to display the file. Note that `$20` here means the character 'white space'.
